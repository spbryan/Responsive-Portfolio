                    <p>My career in IT started on a less traditional path than most. I graduated with a degree in
                        History followed by a Master’s degree in Education. The job market for History teachers was
                        pretty thin at the time but the budding “Dot-Com Boom” and looming “Y2K Disaster” presented a
                        new opportunity. Liberty Mutual was willing to take a chance with people from non-technical
                        majors to be trained internally and so I was able to get my foot in the door.</p>
                    <p>I started my career enhancing a PL1 mainframe system in anticipation of Y2K. By the time the new
                        millenium arrived, and both world and company were still standing, I had shown some aptitude for
                        the profession. I was assigned to a group to design and develop a new Policy Admin system using
                        “cutting edge” technology such as C++ and Aion. Over the years I grew into a technical
                        leadership role and ultimately owner of the domain. Shortly after promotion to Technologist I
                        was asked to refactor this system, this time into web services utilizing Java, BPM and ODM.
                        Years later it is time for another refactor and I am currently in the process of working through
                        designs to break down the monolith, establish distributed microservices, and move to the cloud.

                    <p>Through it all my family has built a very happy life in coastal New Hampshire. My wife and I have
                        three kids, all now (mostly) grown. We now enjoy a quiet house shared with a feisty Jack Russell
                        , a slightly touched Rat Terrier, and a chinchlla named "Gunther". </p>
